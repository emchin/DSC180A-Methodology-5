1. The most interesting topic covered by my domain this quarter was probably figuring out how to get the package into a downloadable form on PyPi. The work we're doing to make sure the package can be used on multiple platforms/environments/computers is really applicable and I'm super motivated to do it (to make sure my teammates can access my code!) It's also been interesting to learn more about Github best practices and merge request practices.
2. Potential investigation to pursue: I'd like to drill down into the basics: what are we doing, what logic are we following in what steps to take next, etc. Why are we using algorithm X versus Y? I want to understand everything the algorithm is doing and understand the potential weaknesses there.
3. Potential change in the current Q1 Project: Possibly slow down on coding and focus more on publishing a paper -- it would be cool to have my name on an academic paper!
4. Other techniques I'd be interested in using: I'd like to establish a good way of staying on top of deliverables (not programming related but project management related). In terms of the project, I'd like to work to improve naming conventions; documentation; testing; and really making the package more ROBUST, not just higher-performing.
