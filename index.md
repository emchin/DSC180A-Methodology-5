## Questions:
1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** I think it's really interesting to learn more about the unspoken etiquette when coding as a team: how to approve a merge request, how to verison for Mac vs Windows, how to approve github merge conflicts, etc.
2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** I'd like to understand more about what the algorithm is doing and understand what our goals are so we can summarize in the Q2 paper. Right now, it feels like we're chasing AUC performance but not understanding the _why_ or steps behind it. I'd like to spend time to ensure our methodology is flawless and our logic is clear.
3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** Our current Quarter 1 project focuses on beating FICO score. I would like to shift the quarter 1 project so we better understand what "beating FICO" means (what metric? does it need to be fast? etc.) which will hopefully help us summarize our findings in our Q1 and Q2 findings.
4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** In Quarter 2, I'd like to delve more into making sure the package is robust/reliable (that is, consistent performance across different systems). This might require more research into how different systems handle different programs; how to auto-update packages/what the package looks like through PyPi; etc. I haven't done much research into the techniques needed for this.
